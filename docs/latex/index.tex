This repository contains a implementation of a simulator of the Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) using Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm to help escape the local minima and search for global ground state. Data analysis and simulations for this study were performed on a Mac\+Book Pro on mac\+OS with a 2 GHz quad-\/core Intel Core i5 processor and 16 GB 3733 MHz LPDDR4X RAM. The CIM was engineered as a photonic device specifically for heuristically tackling Ising-\/optimization problems. Simulating the CIM involves an unconventional approach rooted in dynamical systems, forming a heuristic algorithm that effectively solves Ising problems.

The Hamiltonian of the Ising model, representing the total energy of the system, is given by\+:

\$\$ H = -\/ \textbackslash{}sum\+\_\+\{i,j\} J\+\_\+\{ij\} \textbackslash{}sigma\+\_\+i \textbackslash{}sigma\+\_\+j -\/ \textbackslash{}sum\+\_\+i h\+\_\+i \textbackslash{}sigma\+\_\+i \$\$ where \$\+J\$ is the \$N \textbackslash{}times N\$ coupling matrix and \$h\$ is the external field. In this project, no external field is considered. \$ \textbackslash{}sigma\+\_\+i \textbackslash{}sigma\+\_\+j\$ represent the Ising spin. The project is aimed to reproduce the results of the below papers by integrating the listed algorithms.

All the modules, functions and classes for the CIM algorithm is saved in the {\ttfamily src} folder. The testing intances are the Gsets and MAX-\/\+CUT instances, which are saved in {\ttfamily G\+\_\+sets} and {\ttfamily MC\+\_\+\+Instances} folders respectively. The {\ttfamily Notebooks} folder contains the {\bfseries{introductions}} to the project and the algorithm. They cover topics from solving an Ising model to hyperparameter optimisation.
